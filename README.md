## A* and Dijkstra Pathfinding Algorithms

This project contains a Python implementation of A* (A star) search algorithm that is widely used in path finding and graph traversal, and Dijkstra's algorithm that is used in Cisco router shortest path finding.

### A* Algorithm vs. Dijkstra's Algorithm

Both A* and Dijkstra's algorithms are used for finding paths in graphs, but they have some differences:

- **A* Algorithm**: A* uses a heuristic mechanism, which helps it find paths faster than Dijkstra's algorithm. However, the path it finds may not always be the optimal one because it uses heuristics to make educated guesses.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Dijkstra's algorithm, on the other hand, guarantees the shortest path. It explores all possible paths, making it slower than A* for larger graphs.

### Python Implementation

A Python graphical demo program is provided to animate the progress of path searching using both algorithms. You can see the two resulted paths for comparison.

Replace `URL_TO_YOUR_A_STAR_IMAGE` and `URL_TO_YOUR_DIJKSTRA_IMAGE` with the actual image URLs you obtained from the hosting service for your algorithm demonstration images.

For more details, you can refer to the Python code and documentation in this repository.

#### How to Run the Demo

You can run the demo program by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the Python script to visualize A* and Dijkstra's algorithms in action.

Enjoy exploring the differences between A* and Dijkstra's algorithms!
